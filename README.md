## üìñ Abstract

*This section should contain the abstract of your paper. It provides a concise summary of the research, including the problem, the proposed solution, the methodology, and the key findings. It's recommended to keep it to a few paragraphs.*

**Example:**

Cross-modal retrieval for cultural heritage data often suffers from incomplete and inconsistent annotations. This work introduces C¬≥, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate and enhance the **C**ompleteness and **C**onsistency of textual descriptions associated with cultural heritage images. Our method employs an LLM-driven evaluation pipeline to identify gaps and inaccuracies in existing metadata. Subsequently, we propose a data augmentation strategy that uses the LLM's generative capabilities to create richer, more consistent textual data. By improving the quality of the data, our approach significantly boosts the performance of cross-modal retrieval systems, enabling more accurate and meaningful discovery of cultural heritage artifacts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on several challenging cultural heritage datasets, showing marked improvements over baseline methods.
